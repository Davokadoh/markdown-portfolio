* I *used* to know a bit of C but stopped after a tutorial on RSA. Never used anymore and forgot :/
* I'm *in the process of learning* **Rust** but I have yet to start using it for real
* I started a few **Python** tutorials, stopped halfway each time because I wasn't that motivated
* I *learned* a bit of **Swift** @UNIGE, but did not use it that much
* I *learned* **Java** @EPFL, made two semester project with it:
  * A QR Code encoder
  * A small video game
* Finaly I'm somewhat used to **Linux**, *the command line* and **git**.
